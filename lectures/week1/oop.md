1. Inheritance - parent class can pass it's attributes and methods to a child class (mom and kid have same last name and live in same house)
2. Polymorphism - same method on different objects (mom and kid look and act the same but like different things)
3. Encapsulation - data and behaviors is contained inside the class /  Private VS Global
4. Abstraction - complex actions in simple verbs
