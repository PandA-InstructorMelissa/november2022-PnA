        <h2>The why</h2>
        <p>During their time at Coding Dojo students learn at least 1 Full Stack language.  The last class that every student in the Part Time Accelerated Program  takes is Projects and Algorithms.  In this course they have to create from scratch 2 full stack applications as well as work on Algorithms.  Algorithms are an important skill we teach as they are very often used in Technical interviews.  As a way to make learning these a little more fun and give them a 3rd project, Worduel was born.  Before creating what is now the front end you are reading this from all the logic was built and tested.  It consists of several different types of Algorithms and tested not only their own minds but those who were leading the class.</p>
        <p>So hope you like the game</p>
